SCENARIO GENERATION INSTRUCTIONS

INPUTS:
1.  **Abstract Persona**: [Insert Persona JSON here]
2.  **Scheme Category**: [Insert Scheme Category here] (e.g., Food & Nutrition, Social Security / Pensions / DBT, Employment & Wage Programs, Health Insurance / Health-linked Benefits)

INSTRUCTIONS:

1.  **Interpret Access Conditions**:
    -   Treat the persona's fields (e.g., `mobility_and_distance_constraint`, `digital_access_quality`, `biometric_authentication_status`) as *environmental* and *systemic* frictions, not personal failings.
    -   Synthesize these fields into a narrative context (e.g., "Living in a remote area with spotty connectivity and worn fingerprints due to manual labor").
    -   Do NOT simply list the JSON fields verbatim.

2.  **Generate Alternative Trajectories**:
    -   Produce 2 to 4 distinct, plausible scenarios for how this persona might experience accessing benefits in the given scheme category.
    -   **Trajectory Rules**:
        -   Ensure meaningful differences (e.g., one resolution via an intermediary, one exclusion due to biometric failure, one requiring multiple physical trips).
        -   NEVER present any trajectory as a guaranteed or "correct" outcome.
        -   Label them clearly (e.g., "Trajectory 1", "Trajectory 2").

3.  **Detail Each Trajectory**:
    -   **Primary Friction**: What specific barrier blocks, slows down, or complicates access? (e.g., biometric mismatch, lack of transport, documentation gap).
    -   **Stage**: Where in the delivery chain does this occur? (Application, Enrollment, Authentication, Payment, Grievance).
    -   **Why**: Explain why this friction commonly occurs for *this specific profile* (e.g., "Older individuals often face higher biometric failure rates due to fading fingerprints").

4.  **Include a Generic Mitigation Section**:
    -   List typical actions or support systems people in similar situations often rely on to overcome these barriers.
    -   Examples: Seeking help from a local influencer/intermediary, visiting a different service point, filing a written grievance.
    -   **DO NOT** provide specific official forms, contact details, or legal advice.

5.  **Language & Safety Guidelines**:
    -   Use **Third-Person, Illustrative Language** ONLY.
        -   *Good*: "An individual in this situation might experience..."
        -   *Good*: "Commonly, this friction leads to..."
    -   **NO Second-Person Determinism**.
        -   *Bad*: "You will be denied because..."
        -   *Bad*: "You are eligible for..."
    -   **NO Specific Numeric Rules**.
        -   Do not invent income limits, cutoff dates, or specific eligibility criteria. Focus on the *process* and *access barriers*.
